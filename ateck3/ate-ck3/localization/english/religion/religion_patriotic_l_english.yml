 patriotic_religion_desc:1 "Patriots believe that the ancient Empire of America was a land blessed by Providence, a country where the streets were paved with gold and where every man was free from want and fear. This prosperity stemmed from adherence to Natural Law, which was partially codified in the Constitution by the divine Founders and refined through the ages by the holy Courts. However, the men of old must have strayed from Natural Law, for America is now a shade of its former self, a mere memory of a memory. By revering the old American gods and rediscovering Natural Law, Patriots hope to restore the Empire of America and allow everyone to once again pursue happiness."

 americanist_desc:0 "Americanists believe that Providence cannot be contacted directly, and so Natural Law should only be discerned by wise and accomplished interpreters. In order to ensure that the public's understanding of Natural Law is continually refined and perfected, Americanists have recreated the ancient American Courts. These Courts are led by Judges, who serve as approved interpreters of Natural Law. Through the Courts, Judges can issue binding decisions on disputes between Americanists and pronounce new discoveries in Natural Law. These decisions and pronouncements can, in turn, be checked by the Chief Justice, the wisest and most accomplished Judge in the land."

 libertarian:0 "Libertarian"
 libertarian_adj:0 "Libertarian"
 libertarian_adherent:0 "Libertarian"
 libertarian_adherent_plural:0 "Libertarians"
 libertarian_desc:0 "Libertarians believe that Providence can be contacted by ordinary Patriots through its main feminine form, Lady Liberty. Therefore, Natural Law can understood and discerned by anyone, without the need for interpretation. Although Libertarians still have Judges, they serve primarily as dispute-solvers; their pronouncements on Natural Law are respected but non-binding. Many of Libertarianism's more divergent practices stem from these differences in belief - their worship is directed almost exclusively towards Providence's various feminine forms, and their Judges are exclusively female. The leader of their faith is the First Lady."
