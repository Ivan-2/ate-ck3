 gaian_desc:0 "Gaians worship numerous spirits of nature they consider emanations from Gaia. Also known as Earth Mother, the Goddess, or Primordia, the faithful believe Gaia is a divine spirit interconnected with all living things... the ancient soul of the Earth itself. Gaian theology encourages a society ruled by women rather than men, teaching that man neglected the world and that it was his disregard for the natural balance that led the Earth to ruin."
